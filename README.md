# üëã Hi there, I'm Alvaro Calafell

## üöÄ About Me
I'm an AI/ML Researcher and Data Scientist passionate about pushing the boundaries of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Currently, I'm working on cutting-edge ML research at Stanford University, focusing on meta-learning and hypernetworks for efficient tabular data classification.

## üõ† Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL (HiveSQL, MySQL)
- **ML/AI Frameworks:** PyTorch, Hugging Face, OpenML
- **Tools & Technologies:** SLURM, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, FastAPI, Neo4j
- **Areas of Expertise:** Meta-learning, Hypernetworks, AutoML, A/B Testing, Predictive Modeling, Graph Neural Networks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Vision-Language Models

## üî¨ Projects

### üî• HyperFast v2
**In Progress | Research**
Developing a highly distributed meta-trained hypernetwork aimed at instant tabular data classification. This project surpasses traditional ML methods and AutoML systems, resulting in a **14% improvement** in generalization across diverse datasets.

Key highlights:
- Scaled from 300 to 4,000 training datasets using **OpenML** and **Hugging Face APIs**
- Optimized architecture using **low-rank approximations**, leading to a **30% reduction** in inference time

### ü§ñ [PaLI-Gemma from Scratch](https://github.com/alvarocalafell/Gemma-MLM-from-scratch)
An exploration project aimed at understanding and implementing key components of PaLI-Gemma, a versatile 3B Vision-Language Model for transfer learning:
- Implemented **RoPE** (Rotary Position Embedding) for enhanced position encoding in transformers
- Developed **KV caching** mechanism to optimize inference in large language models
- Built a **SigLIP**-inspired module for efficient multimodal embedding, drawing inspiration from Google's contrastive vision-language model

### üîç [Vector Database API](https://github.com/alvarocalafell/vector-database-api)
A scalable REST API for vector database management and k-NN search, showcasing proficiency in building AI-driven backend solutions. Features include:
- Developed using **Python** and **FastAPI** for high performance and ease of use
- Implementation of multiple indexing algorithms (KD-Tree, Ball Tree, Brute Force) from scratch
- Docker and Kubernetes deployment solution with Helm charts
- **Fully documented** codebase for easy understanding and contribution

### üßë‚Äçüíª [Podcasts GraphRAG](https://github.com/alvarocalafell/podcasts-graphrag)
**In Progress**
This project analyzes **Lex Fridman's podcasts** using **Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG)**. It constructs a **knowledge graph** representing the relationships between concepts discussed in the podcasts, enhancing transcript analysis through:
- **Entity extraction** and **topic modeling**
- A GraphRAG system for enriched context and deep insights into podcast discussions
- Utilizes **Neo4j** to efficiently represent and query the knowledge graphs

### üé® [Stable Diffusion from Scratch](https://github.com/alvarocalafell/stable-diffusion-from-scratch)
An implementation of the **Stable Diffusion** model built entirely from scratch using PyTorch. The project focuses on:
- **Text-to-image** and **image-to-image** generation
- Incorporating modular components like **Rope** (Rotary Positional Encoding) for positional encoding, and **SigLIP** (a custom replacement for CLIP), emphasizing speed and accuracy improvements
- Pre-trained weights from Hugging Face's **v1-5** Stable Diffusion model for enhanced image generation

## üå± I'm currently learning
- Advanced techniques in meta-learning and hypernetworks
- Scaling ML models for distributed computing environments
- Optimizing AI/ML pipelines for high-performance computing
- Graph-based retrieval augmented generation techniques
- Practical implementation of state-of-the-art multimodal AI architectures
